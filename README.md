# pySULI
This repository showcases my and Kevin's work through our 2024 SULI internship at Brookhaven National Lab,
under mentor
- Mehmet Topsakal (https://github.com/MehmetTopsakal/pySULI)

Here are our github pages.

2024-Summer:
- Peter Meshkov (Stony Brook University, https://github.com/pmeshkov)
- Kevin Morell (University of South Carolina, https://github.com/KMorell)

We had some changes in the git structure throughout the summer; this repo in particular was where I made most of my edits to the project,
and then submitted pull requests to the main repo.
